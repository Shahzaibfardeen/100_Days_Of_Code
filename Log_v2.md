**New thing(s) learned:** 
- CSS: details about `@media` property

**Thoughts:**  Though I had some experience with React previously, I wanted to have a fresh start. Modern Javascript frameworks like ReactJS/VueJS can bring great power to projects if can be implemented properly. React completely forces the developers to think differently.
