## Band Name Generator

# Instructions

Write a program that prints the number of characters in a user's name. You might need to Google for a function that calculates the length of a string. 

E.g.

[]()

**Warning.** Your program should work for different inputs. E.g. Any name that you input.

# Example Input

```
Angela
```

# Example Output

```
6
```

E.g. When you hit **run**, this is what should happen:

# Hint

1. You can put functions inside other functions.
2. Don't try to print anything other than the length.
